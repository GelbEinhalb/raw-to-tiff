A **very** simple and basic tool for quickly converting raw camera files like `.cr2`, `.nef`, `.arw`, `.dng` and `.raw` to `.tiff`.

The tool is written in python and based on the `rawpy` library.
It uses multithreading to convert images as fast as possible, hopefully without loosing any image quality during conversion.
