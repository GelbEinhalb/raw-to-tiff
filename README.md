# Raw to Tiff
A **very** simple and **basic** tool for quickly converting raw camera files like `.cr2`, `.nef`, `.arw`, `.dng` and `.raw` to `.tiff`.

This tool was written in a hurry and did not undergo proper testing as you might see by the missing `test/` folder.
There are probably a million free tools out there that do a better job than mine so use them instead :D

*If you are insane enough to trust this code, go ahead and have fun!*

## Why should I use it?
- Don't know if it works (It does with my testcases)!
- Don't know if it's save!
- Don't trust it if your life depends on it!
